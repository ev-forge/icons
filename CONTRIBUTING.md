## âœ¨ Contributing Icons

If you are contributing a new icon (after your RFC was approved):

1.  Add your new `.svg` file to the appropriate category in `packages/icon-library/src/assets/community`.
2.  **Regenerate the icon metadata.** This is a critical step. Run the following command from the **root directory**:
    ```bash
    pnpm icons:generate
    ```
    This command updates the necessary type definitions and asset manifests for both the library and the docs site.
