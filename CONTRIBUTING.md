## âœ¨ Contributing Icons

If you are contributing a new icon (after your RFC was approved):

1. Design you icon on 512px x 512px without paddings, then you need to simplify it to reduce size, you can use this tool: https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/, then make sure you have this properties in the svg:

   - `viewBox="0 0 512 512"` ensure it is a square
   - `width="1em"` and `height="1em"` inherit the font size
   - `fill="currentColor"` inherit the text color, then remove the colors property on the `path` tags to inherit from `svg`

2. Add your new `.svg` file to the appropriate category in `packages/icons/src/assets/community`.
3. **Regenerate the icon metadata.** This is a critical step. Run the following command from the **root directory**:
   ```bash
   pnpm icons:generate
   ```
   This command updates the necessary type definitions and asset manifests for both the library and the docs site.
