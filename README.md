A lightweight icon library delivering Font Awesome's high-quality icons via a framework-agnostic Web Component, with perfect, icon-level tree-shaking.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üì¶ Minimal Bundle Size:** Your final bundle only includes the icons you actually import. Over 80% smaller than traditional component libraries in our benchmarks.
- **üå≥ Perfect Tree-shaking:** The architecture ensures that unused icons are always eliminated from your production build.
- **üß© Framework Agnostic:** Built with a native Web Component. Works in React, Svelte, Vue, Astro, or simple HTML without wrappers.
- **üé® Intuitive Styling:** Style icons directly with your favorite utility classes. No new APIs to learn.
- **üöÄ Simple API:** No complex configuration. Import your icon's SVG and pass it to the component.

## üöÄ Performance Snapshot

`@ev-forge/icons` is designed for performance. In a benchmark simulating a modern application (a Vite + React SPA loading 32 unique icons), `@ev-forge/icons` demonstrates a significantly smaller impact on the final bundle.

**Benchmark Results:**
| Library | Bundle Impact (gzip) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`** | `~144 KB` |
| **`@ev-forge/icons`** | `~26 KB` |

_For a detailed analysis and to reproduce these results, please see the [benchmark package's README](./apps/benchmark-vite-react/README.md)._

## üèÅ Get Started (vite/react)

- install: `npm i @ev-forge/icons`
- set up the types in your tsconfig: `include: ["node_modules/@ev-forge/icons/dist/global.d.ts"]`
- import and use it:

```tsx
// 1. import icons
import { svgHomeSolid, svgRadioSolid } from "@ev-forge/icons";

// 2. use them in ev-icon
function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ev-icon svg={svgHomeSolid} class="w-6 text-blue-500" />
      <ev-icon svg={svgRadioSolid} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
